Using this repository to test new skills in programming that I am learning about.

**24 March 2019**
Learning to use Git via the command line:
  1. config command: to add username and email
  2. init command: to create repository
  3. Drag and Drop file into repository
  4. add command: to add a file to the next commit and stages *note the file must already be in the repository via drag and     
     drop.
  5. gui command: to open the gui so that I can move unstaged change to staged change then commit and push to GitHub. 
                if I don't want to use the add command and commit command which does the same thing
  6. commit -m "Insert Commit Message Here" command: Prepares to be uploaded to remote repository  
  7. remote command:
     $ git remote add origin remote repository URL
     //Sets the new remote
     $ git remote -v
     //Verifies the new remote URL
  8. git push -u origin master
Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository
