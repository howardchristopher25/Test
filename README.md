Test

Using this repository to test new skills in programming that I am learning about.

24 March 2019
Learning to use Git via the command line:
  -config command: to add username and email
  -init command: to create repository
  -Drag and Drop file into repository
  -add command: to add a file to the next commit and stages *note the file must already be in the repository via drag and drop.
  -gui command: to open the gui so that I can move unstaged change to staged change then commit and push to GitHub. 
                if I don't want to use the add command and commit command which does the same thing
  -commit -m "Insert Commit Message Here" command: Prepares to be uploaded to remote repository
  
- remote command:
$ git remote add origin remote repository URL
# Sets the new remote
$ git remote -v
# Verifies the new remote URL
  
$ git push -u origin master
# Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository
